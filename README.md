This repository demonstrates a common error in Groovy related to checking for null values in collections. The `bug.groovy` file contains the erroneous code that leads to a `NullPointerException` when the input parameter is a collection. The `bugSolution.groovy` file provides a corrected version that handles collection null checks effectively.
